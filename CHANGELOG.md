# Changelog

## 1.4.8 / 1.3.6 - 2026-09-17

- Tolerate malformed Claude JSONL records and continue importing valid records.
- Deduplicate reconciliation diagnostics and keep plain launches responsive.
- Run resume-catalog preparation asynchronously so the foreground TUI is not
  blocked by bootstrap or native-session discovery.

## 1.4.7 / 1.3.5 - 2026-09-17

- Prepare the active canonical session for the official Claude/Codex resume
  catalog without automatically selecting it in the foreground TUI.
- Add idempotent native projection materialization with canonical cursor and
  provenance tracking.
- Resume an existing Codex native session when only the canonical cursor is
  stale, injecting the deterministic delta; bootstrap is now fallback-only.
- Persist deterministic `state.json` and `handoff.json`/`handoff.md` artifacts
  without writing Claude or Codex private session storage.

## 1.4.6 - 2026-09-17

- Keep ordinary `avenic <agent>` launches transparent: shared canonical
  continuation is now opt-in via `avenic sessions continue`.
- Make `self-update` report registry/current/active versions and verify the
  executable actually selected by PATH after installation.

## 1.4.5 - 2026-09-17

- Keep Claude, Codex, and OpenCode foreground launches attached to the user's
  terminal; continuation handoff is passed as an initial prompt instead of a
  non-interactive stdin pipe.
- Use official interactive Codex `resume`/bootstrap commands for TUI sessions.

## 1.4.4 - 2026-09-17

- Restrict Codex native capture to rollouts belonging to the current project
  directory, preventing cross-project history capture during rehydration.

## 1.4.3 - 2026-09-17

- Safely rehydrate a canonical continuation into a new Codex native thread when
  the mapped thread is already occupied by another Codex process.
- Preserve canonical source-of-truth history, abrupt-exit reconciliation, stale
  native projection recovery, historical session import, and independent
  Auth × Sessions modes.
- Keep Claude/Codex continuation at semantic L3a; Codex native-faithful L3b is
  not claimed.

## 1.4.0 - 2026-09-16

- Added startup recovery for abrupt exits: canonical sessions remain durable,
  native projections are reconciled before launch, and missing projections are
  rehydrated without deleting native history.
- Added historical native-session import, active canonical-session selection,
  and independent global/project Auth and Sessions modes.

- Added unified canonical sessions for Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode.
- Added Claude → Codex → Claude semantic continuation with incremental shared context.
- Preserved existing agent authentication, provider, cc-switch, and project auth behavior.
- Added Codex installation provenance and source-appropriate update handling.
- Made Skills and Catalog views cache-first, with coalesced refreshes and explicit network sync.
- Fixed Linux fresh-folder Skills and Catalog loading behavior.
